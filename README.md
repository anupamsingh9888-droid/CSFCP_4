This project is a simple mini-application created using VS Code and managed with Git and GitHub. It includes basic functionality, clear documentation, and a proper repository structure. The project contains features such as core program logic, easy usage flow, and clean code formatting. It uses Git for version control, including multiple meaningful commits, a .gitignore file, and a detailed README. To use the project, clone the repository, open it in VS Code, and run the main program based on the chosen language (Python/Java/C/HTML-CSS). The repository includes screenshots, a docs/ folder with project overview, development process, and future improvements. The development process involved coding, testing, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and organizing documentation. Future improvements may include adding more features, improving UI, or optimizing performance. This project demonstrates practical learning of tools like VS Code, Git, and GitHub while building a simple real-world application.
